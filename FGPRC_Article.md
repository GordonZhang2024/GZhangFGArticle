- Wiki:

- FlightGear 与众多模拟器 最本质上的区别， 它是自由、开源 (Free & Open Source, aka FOSS)软件, （重点并不是免费）
>“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that  **the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software**. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.

>You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to  [sell copies](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html).
